## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `opencv-python`
- `Pillow` (PIL)
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mistlp74/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pillow
    ```

---

## Usage

1. Make sure there are font files in the `fonts` folder and emotion images in the `DataBase` subfolders (`smile`, `angry`, `surprise`).
2. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. Use the buttons in the interface to:
    - Upload an image
    - Add custom text
    - Save the result
    - Auto-generate a meme

## Project Structure

- `main.py` — main GUI application
- `AutoGenerator.py` — automatic meme generation logic
- `fonts/` — folder for TTF font files (e.g., `comic.ttf`)
- `DataBase/` — contains subfolders with emotion images:
    - `smile/`
    - `angry/`
    - `surprise/`

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No fonts available:** Add TTF font files (e.g., `comic.ttf`) to the `fonts` directory.
- **No images for meme generation:** Ensure each emotion folder in `DataBase` contains images.
- **Image not displayed:** Check that dependencies are installed and image formats are supported.
